==== Plugins

*Plugin Core*

404: Not Found

*Avro Codec*

*Cef Codec*

* Fixed CEF short to long name translation for ahost/agentHostName field, according to documentation [#75](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/pull/75)

* Fixed support for deep dot notation [#73](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/pull/73)

* Removed obsolete `sev` and `deprecated_v1_fields` fields

* Fixed minor doc inconsistencies (added reverse_mapping to options table, moved it to alpha order in option descriptions, fixed typo)
  [#60](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/pull/60)

* Added reverse_mapping option, which can be used to make encoder compliant to spec [#51](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/pull/51)

* Fix handling of malformed inputs that have illegal unescaped-equals characters in extension field values (restores behaviour from <= v5.0.3 in some edge-cases) ([#56](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/issues/56))

* Fix bug in parsing headers where certain legal escape sequences could cause non-escaped pipe characters to be ignored.
* Fix bug in parsing extension values where a legal unescaped space in a field's value could be interpreted as a field separator (#54)
* Add explicit handling for extension key names that use array-like syntax that isn't legal with the strict-mode field-reference parser (e.g., `fieldname[0]` becomes `[fieldname][0]`).

* Fix handling of higher-plane UTF-8 characters in message body

* Update gemspec summary

* Fix some documentation issues

* move `sev` and `deprecated_v1_fields` fields from deprecated to obsolete

* added mapping for outcome = eventOutcome from CEF whitepaper (ref:p26/39)

* changed rt from receiptTime to deviceReceiptTime (ref:p27/39)
* changed tokenizer to include additional fields (ad.fieldname)

* Add `delimiter` setting. This allows the decoder to be used with inputs like the TCP input where event delimiters are used.

* Implements the dictionary translation for abbreviated CEF field names from chapter Chapter 2: ArcSight Extension Dictionary page 3 of 39 [CEF specification](https://protect724.hp.com/docs/DOC-1072).
* add `_cefparsefailure` tag on failed decode

* breaking: Updated plugin to use new Java Event APIs

* Switch in-place sub! to sub when extracting `cef_version`. new Logstash Java Event does not support in-place String changes.

* Depend on logstash-core-plugin-api instead of logstash-core, removing the need to mass update plugins on major releases of logstash

* New dependency requirements for logstash-core for the 5.0 release

* Implements `encode` with escaping according to the [CEF specification](https://protect724.hp.com/docs/DOC-1072).
* Config option `sev` is deprecated, use `severity` instead.

* Plugins were updated to follow the new shutdown semantic, this mainly allows Logstash to instruct input plugins to terminate gracefully,
   instead of using Thread.raise on the plugins' threads. Ref: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/3895
* Dependency on logstash-core update to 2.0

*Collectd Codec*

*Dots Codec*

*Edn Codec*

*Edn_lines Codec*

* Added ability to directly convert from integer and float to boolean [#127](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-mutate/pull/127)

* Changed documentation to clarify execution order and to provide workaround 
 [#128](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-mutate/pull/128)

* Changed documentation to clarify use of `replace` config option [#125](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-mutate/pull/125)

* Fix: when converting to `float` and `float_eu`, explicitly support same range of inputs as their integer counterparts; eliminates a regression introduced in 3.3.1 in which support for non-string inputs was inadvertently removed.

* Fix: Number strings using a **decimal comma** (e.g. 1,23), added convert support to specify integer_eu and float_eu.

* feature: Added capitalize feature.

* Support boolean to integer conversion https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-mutate/issues/107[#107]

* Update gemspec summary

[[logstash-7-2-0]]
=== Logstash 7.2.0 Release Notes

* Native support for Java Plugins (GA) https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/10620[#10620]. Changes to Java plugins for GA include:

   ** BREAKING: The signature for the codec.encode() method was changed to make the codec API easier to use correctly in pipelines with multiple concurrent workers.
   ** BREAKING: The return type on the Context::getDlqWriter method was changed to an interface to decouple it from any specific DLQ implementation.
   ** BETA: Isolated classloader for Java plugins. When enabled with the pipeline.plugin_classloaders flag, each Java plugin will be loaded with its own parent-last classloader. All dependencies for the Java plugin, with the exception of any classes in org.logstash.* or co.elastic.logstash.* packages, will be loaded first from the plugin's jar file delegating to the main Logstash classloader only if the dependency is not found within the plugin's jar. This allows Java plugins to use dependencies that might clash with the dependencies for other Java plugins or Logstash core itself.
   ** Gradle tasks to automate the packaging of Java plugins as Ruby gems. The gem task will bootstrap all JRuby dependencies, automatically generate Gemfile and the gemspec file for the plugin as well as the two "glue" Ruby source files for triggering the loading of the Java class files during Logstash startup, and then invoke the necessary commands to create the gem file itself. The gem task also performs a number of validation checks to proactively identify common problems with the packaging of Java plugins. The clean task will remove all of those generated artifacts.
   ** Java plugin validation. At pipeline startup, all Java plugins will be checked to ensure that they implement the same version of the Java plugin API present in the current Logstash version.
   ** DLQ writer interface provided to Java plugins.
   ** Float, URI, and password config types, each of which provide validation for the supplied config value.
   ** New built-in Java plugins:
   *** A Java-based generator input for testing with the same capabilities as the Ruby generator input as well as an optional eps option to generate events at a given event-per-second rate for situations where as-fast-as-possible event generation is too much.
   *** Also includes a jdots codec that mirrors the Ruby dots codec.
   *** Java-based sink output that discards any events received. Analogous to the Ruby null plugin though much faster.

* Documentation: Add details about Elastic Search dependency https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/10852[#10852]
